The `Esensi/Model` package is just one package that makes up [Esensi](https://github.com/esensi), a platform built on [Laravel](http://laravel.com). This package bundles [PHP traits](http://php.net/traits) that extend Laravel's default Eloquent models and traits. Using traits allows for a high-degree of code reusability and extensibility. While this package provides some reasonable base models, as a developer you're free to mix and match traits in any combination you need, being confident that the code complies to a reliable interface and is properly unit tested. For more details on the inner workings of the traits please consult the generously documented source code.
